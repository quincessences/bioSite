            <!-- biography -->
            <p>
                Sergey was born in Novosibirsk, often referred to as the capital of Siberia, in former USSR, now Russia.
            </p>
            <p>
                Sergey studied chemistry in a teaching institute as at the time, it was the most accessible route in life. However, his mother sent him to musical school very early on. He didn’t enjoy it back then – his mother had to pay him to attend conservatory concerts. Later in life, he began enjoying it. To this day, he plays the piano in the mornings while he drinks his coffee. His favorite composer is Chopin and he often chooses his pieces to play. 
            </p>
            <p>
                When the USSR collapsed, like many, he had to change his career, and got into the business sphere. He switched jobs often as he thought that would be best for his career and ensured he continued learning and being engaged with his work. He didn’t have official business education but had very good understanding of how business worked. As a result, he eventually switched to freelance project and risk management work.
            </p>
            <p>
                Part of his motivation to be freelance was to build his life in a way that allowed him to stay with his family. With his wife moving every few years as her career progressed in an international organization, it was beneficial for him to have a job that allowed him to be completely flexible and follow his own schedule. It also allowed him to spend more time with his young son. In the recent years, he has moved across a few countries: Russia, Ukraine, then a few years in Serbia, and then finally to Switzerland. He enjoyed most of them and found a way to absorb the culture and way of life of every new home he had.
            </p>
            <p>
                He likes having a job that allows him to be that free and doesn’t tie him down to any specific place or any office, ensuring he can be comfortable and doesn’t have to compromise on spending time with his family. He picked up biking and skiing when he moved to Switzerland, as they’re easily available, and he enjoys them with his son.
