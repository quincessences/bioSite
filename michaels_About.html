    <p class="about">
        Sergey was born in Novosibirsk, often referred to as the capital of Siberia, in former USSR, now Russia. Initially, he planned to study in a teaching institute as that was the path for most people. His mother sent him to musical school very early on, he used to be paid to go to the conservatory. Later in life, he started really enjoying it and playing the piano for fun and does it to this day. His favorite composer is Chopin, and he often chooses his pieces to play.

        When the USSR collapsed, he decided to switch out of his chemistry teacher career and like many followed into business. He had a lot of jobs and switched very often as he thought that would be best for his career. He didn’t have official business education but had very good understanding of how it worked. As a result, he eventually switched to freelance work and working on projects. Part of it was to build his life in a way that allowed him to stay with his family. With his wife constantly needing to move every few years for her job, it was good for him to have a job that allowed him to be completely flexible. It also allowed him to spend more time with his young son. With his family, he has moved across a few countries, Russia, then Ukraine, then a few years in Serbia, and then finally to Switzerland. He enjoyed most of them and found a way to enjoy learning a new place. He likes having a job that allows him to be that free and doesn’t tie him down to any specific place or any office, ensuring he can be comfortable and doesn’t have to compromise on spending time with his family. He picked up biking and skiing when he moved to Switzerland, as they’re easily available, and he can do them with his son.
